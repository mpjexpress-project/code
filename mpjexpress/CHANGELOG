Version 0.39
------------

1. This release mainly introduces a new MPJ Express device 'hybdev' that 
   supports hybrid parallelism on cluster of multicore machines. The device, 
   hybdev, transparently achieves hybrid parallelism. It does not require 
   code rewriting effort for new and existing MPJ Express applications. It 
   is developed by Ansar Javed and Mohsan Jameel.
  
2. In xdev.Device.java an overloaded abstract method 'iprove' is added
   public abstract mpjdev.Status iprobe (ProcessID srcID, ProcessID dstID, 
   int tag, int context);
   It is used by hybdev to probe messages in network device.

3. In xdev.Device interface an abstract method 'iprobeAndFetch' is added
   public abstract mpjdev.Status iprobeAndFetch (ProcessID srcID, 
   ProcessID dstID, int tag, int context, mpjbuf.Buffer buf);
   It is required for Hybrid device to provide support for wildcard messages.
  
4. ProcTree.java is added in xdev/niodev package, previously it was imported 
   from MPI layer.

5. Add and remove methods of ArrQueue and RecvQueue in niodev are updated. 
   The message addition and removal process in the queues is based on the 
   message key 
   Now key consists of Source, Destination, tag, context.

6. Hybrid device support is added in runtime classes i.e. MPJDaemon and MPJRun. 
   Two new Java classes are added in runtime as well.
   a. HybridDaemon
   b. HybridStarter

Version 0.38
------------

1. Fixed a bug in the mpjrun module that appends null as the host name 
   in the configuration file. Thanks to Pete Christopher for 
   identifying this bug. 14/1/2011

Version 0.37
------------

1. Added the executing and debugging tutorial of MPJ Express applications
   using Eclipse IDE. 14/5/2010
2. Modified the runtime to get rid of the shared directory requirement 
   between the starter (head node) and daemons (running on compute nodes).
   This paper is coded by Rizwan Hanif and Amjad Aziz. 6/1/2011
3. Fixed a bug that causes daemons to crash on Windows boxes. 4/1/2011

Version 0.36
------------

1. Fixed the mpjboot error for Mac OS X reported by Ed Baskerville. The
   mpjboot script used x86 binaries on Mac OS X, which obviously was incorrect.

2. The MPJ Express runtime could not start more than 100 processes. 
   Guillermo Lopez Taboada identified and proposed and a fix for this.  
   18/3/2010
3. Fixed the bug which broke test cases when executed with odd number of
   processes. Many thanks to Guillermo Lopez Taboada for discovering 
   this bug. 18/3/2010 
4. Made changes to the MPJ Express runtime system and got rid of a couple 
   of internal classes. 
5. On some clusters, users complained that MPJ Express took abnormally 
   long amount of time to bootstrap. We have fixed this bug in this release.
